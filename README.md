SwiftVector
===========

A vector library in Swift. This is my vector lib. There are many like it but this one is mine.

This library is pretty minimal. I'll only grow it as I need more functions for my personal development. Feel free to make use of it or update it if you need specific functions.

Some notes:

vec2 is immutable. Any methods on a vector create a new object.

I don't generally like operator overloading. It's seductive, but it tends to make code harder to read and debug.
